You feel like you’re drowning...
You can’t see the light...
You can’t breathe the stale air...
You’re blinded by the darkness...
It feels like your heart is stopping...
You feel like a discarded broken toy...
You feel like a villain in a fairy tale...
You imagine yourself as a shattered mirror...
You feel a million needles penetrating your skin...
You feel your story nearing its end...
An unbreakable curtain covers your path...
You feel nightmares overcoming dreams...
You feel yourself severing from fate...
