A pall of unease falls over you...
Darkness looms at perception’s edge...
You feel like you’re seeing things...
Something beyond is watching...
You feel the cards stacking against you...
Dreams never last...
Something flickers in your periphery...
You feel your luck falter...
You feel the dominoes falling...
You see a reflection of something sinister...
You feel your convictions shaking...
It feels like you have one chip left...
You get a sense of Deja Vu...
You feel a grand plan coming together...
The stars cross far above you...
Your hair stands on end...
