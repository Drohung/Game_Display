It's the end of all things.
The Prince knows not what he does.
Time is coming unwound.
You feel something stir within you.
You feel another’s comfort.
You feel their love.
You feel safe.
You feel a fire in your heart.
You feel a childlike hope.
Your soul fills with determination.
Break the bond.
Wake the slumbering Prince.
Shatter the twilight reverie.
End this reflection.
Save the World!
