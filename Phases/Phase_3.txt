The wind is howling...
You feel a blade at your throat...
Victory draws ever further away...
It feels like you’ve been here before...
Echoes of a life once lived...
The clash of steel echoes beyond...
An alien desire invades your mind...
You hear voices that speak no words...
You feel a terror that isn’t yours...
You feel a roar but hear no sound...
You feel like you’ve made a terrible mistake...
You feel darkness consuming you...
You have no mouth, yet you need to scream...
You feel like you must kneel and submit...
You feel the endless black surround you...
You feel like you’re chasing the impossible...
