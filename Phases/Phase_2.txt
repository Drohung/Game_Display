Your feet feel heavy...
Your strength begins to falter...
Your blood runs cold...
Your muscles ache...
Your chest feels tight...
Exhaustion grows in your body...
You feel a growing numbness...
Your heart skips a beat...
Your head begins to hurt...
You feel bricks tied to your limbs...
You feel yourself aging faster...
It’s like swimming through tar...
Your bones feel sore...
Your stomach twists in a knot...
You feel like you haven’t slept in days...
